# Global_Superstore_Sales_Dashboard_PowerBi
OBJECTIVES:
The objective of the Global Superstore Sales Analysis Repository is to develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that delivers actionable insights into sales performance. This project aims to empower stakeholders with key information and trends, facilitating informed decision-making processes. By leveraging data analysis techniques, the goal is to provide accurate sales forecasting and meaningful comparisons, ultimately contributing to the success of the Global Superstore business.
SUMMARY:
To construct the dashboard, the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was executed in alignment with project specifications. Power Query served as the primary tool for data cleansing and transformation, ensuring data integrity and usability. Additionally, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was employed to craft calculated measures and columns, enhancing the dashboard's analytical capabilities and providing valuable insights for decision-making purposes.
After completing the calculations, I created visualizations and generated reports using a variety of tools such as cards, filters, slicers, charts, forecasting, comparisons, and decomposition. These elements were strategically incorporated to ensure ease of understanding for end-users and to deliver meaningful insights derived from the data. This approach facilitates intuitive navigation through the dashboard while providing actionable information to support decision-making processes effectively.
